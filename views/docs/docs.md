## [Heading](#heading)

Adding Headings to your markdown article is very straightforward. <br>
We have in all 6 types of headings at our disposal :

| [Heading type](blue) | [Prefix](yellow) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| h1                   | #                |
| h2                   | ##               |
| h3                   | ###              |
| h4                   | ####             |
| h5                   | #####            |
| h6                   | ######           |

This is the first Line.
This line will follows the previous.

### [Colored Text](#coloredtext)

You can color any text (headings, normal text, lists, etc) [in](blue) [many](red) [different](yellow) [colors](green).

Here is an ever expanding list of Colors. (We keep adding more colors all the time.)

| colorName | Sample Text               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| _red_     | [**Lorem ipsum**](red)    |
| _green_   | [**Lorem ipsum**](green)  |
| _blue_    | [**Lorem ipsum**](blue)   |
| _yellow_  | [**Lorem ipsum**](yellow) |
| _purple_  | [**Lorem ipsum**](purple) |

<br>
To Apply the color, follow this syntax

```
[Text that you want to display](colorName)
```

<hr>

### [Example](red)

```
[This is Sample Text, red in color](red)
```

[This is Sample Text, red in color](red)

### [Links](#links)

Markdown makes linking to other Websites, Articles, Pages and Media extremely simple.

All you have to is follow this basic syntax:

```
[Text You want to Show](websiteYouWantToLink.com)
```

<hr>

### [Example](red)

```
[Click to See a Good Boy](https://bit.ly/veryfastgoodboy)
```

[Click to See a Good Boy](https://bit.ly/veryfastgoodboy)

<hr>
<hr>

### [Images](#images)

Inserting Images is very similar to Links.

Follow the following simple syntax:

```
![some caption text](linkToTheImage.net)
```

Additionally you can add titles of ["medium_big"](yellow) and ["big_img"](red) to get images that are [70%](yellow) and [95%](red) of the article in width, respectively.

[Note : ](yellow) Images will automatically fit to accomodate screen sizes on Mobile

<hr>

### [Example](red)

_[Standard Image Example](blue)_

```
![This is Good Boy](https://bit.ly/veryfastgoodboy)
```

![This is Good Boy](https://bit.ly/veryfastgoodboy)

_[Medium Image Example](yellow)_

```
![This is Good Boy](https://bit.ly/veryfastgoodboy "medium_img")
```

![This is Good Boy](https://bit.ly/veryfastgoodboy "medium_img")

_[Large Image Example](red)_
